# 🩺 Predicting Diabetes Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Title  
**Predicting Diabetes Using Linear Regression**

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The objective of this project is to build a **Linear Regression model** to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical attributes such as:

- Age  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Insulin Level  
- Blood Pressure  

---

## 📖 Description  
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and prevention.

In this project, we use **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to analyze relationships between patient health parameters and diabetes outcomes.

The model learns from the dataset and predicts a continuous output representing diabetes progression/risk.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used  
**Linear Regression**

Linear Regression models the relationship between:

Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ

Where:  
- Y → Predicted diabetes value  
- X → Input features (Age, BMI, Insulin, BP)

## ⚙️ Steps Involved  

1. Import required libraries  
2. Load the dataset  
3. Perform preprocessing (if needed)  
4. Split dataset into training & testing sets  
5. Train Linear Regression model  
6. Predict outcomes  
7. Evaluate performance
